# Private Web3 Storage with (EVM) Sapphire Oasis Paratime Chain üåêüîó
This project provides a secure and efficient way to upload files to IPFS using Web3.Storage, while also integrating with the Sapphire Oasis EVM Chain for enhanced functionalities and increased security. By way of a contract with hidden-states, the project provides for more complex functionality that can be used for dapps and defi, amongst other things.  

## Features üåü

- Secure File Upload: Upload files to IPFS securely via Web3.Storage.
- File Encryption: Files are encrypted based on the user's Ethereum address and a server-side secret.
- File Retrieval: Retrieve files from IPFS and decrypt them to access the original content.
- Sapphire Oasis Integration: Leverage the Sapphire Oasis EVM Chain for added features.
-User Authentication: Authenticate users and sign messages using RainbowKit.
-Privacy with Traceability: Pseudo-anonymous IDs ensure user privacy and are further obfuscated by storing them in confedential contracts.  However, according to Oasis, there is a backdoor to verify content on some level. In the future we will include pseudoanonymous-files and pseudo pseudoanonymous-address injections on-chain for enhanced security.  


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vivecboots/Ursidae_Utility
cd Ursidae_Utility
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Environment Variables:

Create a .env.local file in the root directory and set up your environment variables. (I will soon be removing NEXT_PUBLIC_, still under construction... )  NEXT_PUBLIC_SECRET_KEY= [Can be anything you choose]


```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3_STORAGE_API_KEY=your_web3_storage_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_for_encryption
NEXT_PUBLIC_OASYS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_OASYS_CONTRACT_ABI=your_contract_abi
NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUR_RPC_URL=your_rpc_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key

```

Start the server

```bash
npm run dev
```


## Usage/Examples

- Connect Wallet:
Click on the Connect button to connect your Ethereum wallet.

- Upload File:
-Select a file using the file input.

-Click on the Upload Content button to securely upload the file to IPFS.

-  Retrieve File:
-Input the CID of the file you want to retrieve.

-Click on the Retrieve Content button to fetch and decrypt the file.

- Sign Message:
Click on the Sign message button to sign a custom message using your Ethereum wallet (for testing purposes).

## API Documentation:

#### Upload Endpoint

```http
/api/upload
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `file` | `All` | **Required**. authorization/sign msg |

#### Retrieve Endpoint

Feature not yet supported. Files can be retrieved directly from web3.storage or with API call. Sign up for web3.storage and provide API key in .env file.  Additional functionality to be added soon which will allow the product to serve dapps exclusively in the backend.

## Todo:  
- Socks5 integration/ tor for the host website integration
- pseudo pseudoanonymous-address and document stuffing
- Deployment to Akash or Fleek.xyz when it arrives to decentralize

## Reflections

!By way of Oasis protocol, it is possible for law enforcement to open the contract if given permission to do so by Oasis Protocol. This would give people the ability to see pseudoanonymous user addresses.  Of course, it is up to the user to remain confidential with proper use of their wallet and internet use.  Using tor and Socks5 can greatly reduce privacy concerns and is in consideration as well as full decentralization using Akash, Fleek.xyz.  HOWEVER, this appareant acheles heel is actually its strength as it isn't legally in a gray area because of this.  There is a pending lawsuit against one privacy provider right now, and they too had a backdoor function and follwed techniques of decentralization, which leads me to believe the lawsuit likely regard something else. Privacy will be fought for on both sides, those in power and those not in power will both want seek some modicum of privacy, and both sides will undoubtebly want the accountabiltiy that comes with open ledgers and publicly available transactions.  As of right now, anyone can make secret transactions and we do so on a daily basis in our own lives with money. It will take some time and fundamental shifts in thinking to tackle these new challenges. One last thought on those who may not see privacy as any kind of a concern.  If in your own life, anyone could look up all of your finacnial transactions, would you be okay with that, would you be secure, and would you be safe?  The first is a personal conclusion that you decide, the last two are undoubtedly no.  How do you balance these needs then? If you live in a city, you have a sense of anonymity. In a near future wher AR can instantly tell you everything about a stranger, how would society fundamentally change if a person was only measured by their past such as credit score, rather than what they are doing today to hopefully contribute to the world.  Does it create a feedback loop, where everything in society becomes amplified? We don't know yet, and there's no truly informed guesses. Thank you for checking out the repository.
