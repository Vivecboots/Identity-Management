# Private Web3 Storage with (EVM) Sapphire Oasis Paratime Chain üåêüîó
This project provides a secure and efficient way to upload files to IPFS using Web3.Storage, while also integrating with the Sapphire Oasis EVM Chain for enhanced functionalities.

## Features üåü

- Secure File Upload: Upload files to IPFS securely via Web3.Storage.
- File Encryption: Files are encrypted based on the user's Ethereum address and a server-side secret.
- File Retrieval: Retrieve files from IPFS and decrypt them to access the original content.
- Sapphire Oasis Integration: Leverage the Sapphire Oasis EVM Chain for added features.
-User Authentication: Authenticate users and sign messages using RainbowKit.
-Privacy with Traceability: Pseudo-anonymous IDs ensure user privacy and are further obfuscate the author.  However, according to Oasis, there is a backdoor to verify content on some level.  




Privacy with Traceability: Pseudo-anonymous IDs ensure user privacy, but with cryptographic traceability for law enforcement via Oasis' zk-SNARKs protocol.
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vivecboots/Ursidae_Utility
cd Ursidae_Utility
```

Install dependencies

Environment Variables:

Create a .env.local file in the root directory and set up your environment variables. (I will soon be removing NEXT_PUBLIC_, still under construction... )


```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3_STORAGE_API_KEY=your_web3_storage_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_for_encryption
NEXT_PUBLIC_OASYS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_OASYS_CONTRACT_ABI=your_contract_abi
NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUR_RPC_URL=your_rpc_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key

```

Start the server

```bash
npm run dev
```
