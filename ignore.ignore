Steps to Move Forward with the Decentralized File Storage System:
1. File Upload Interface
In your pages/index.tsx, design a file upload form. This will be the starting point for users wanting to store files on Filecoin.
2. File Retrieval Interface
Implement a mechanism (like an input field) for users to provide a file's public hash. This will be used to retrieve files from Filecoin.
3. Backend Development
You need to set up API routes in Next.js (under the pages/api directory) to handle:
File uploads: Encrypt the file, store it on Filecoin, and return the necessary hashes.
File retrievals: Accept the file's public hash, fetch and decrypt the file from Filecoin, and return the file to the frontend.
4. Filecoin Integration
Integrate with Filecoin within the API routes to handle the storage and retrieval of files.
5. Oasis Integration for Privacy
Within the API routes, before storing files to Filecoin, use Oasis for encryption. Similarly, decrypt files using Oasis when retrieving them.
6. SOCKS5 Proxy Integration
If you're concerned about maintaining the privacy of server-side operations, consider routing your server's traffic through a SOCKS5 proxy. This can be set up at the server level or integrated into your API logic.
7. Test the System
Before proceeding further, ensure the file upload and retrieval system works flawlessly. Test with different file types and sizes.
8. Extend the Platform
Once the basic file storage system is operational, think about extending the platform. Given the context of a news site where authors can receive donations:
Integrate a donation mechanism using Ethereum smart contracts.
Allow authors to have profiles, list their articles, and display donation stats.
9. Refine the UI/UX
Based on feedback and user testing, refine the user interface and experience. Add helpful tooltips, error messages, and feedback mechanisms.
10. Deployment and Scaling
Deploy the updated Next.js application. Consider scalability, especially if you anticipate a lot of users interacting with the system.
11. Documentation
Update the user documentation to guide users on how to use the platform, upload files, retrieve files, and make donations.




Given our current goal is to create an article module that:

Allows for the upload of an article.
Encrypts and stores the article on Filecoin.
Provides a method to retrieve the encrypted article.
Offers additional identifiers for future integration.
Flow:

User Interaction:

User connects their Ethereum wallet.
User uploads an article file.
The file gets split into two parts:
Article metadata (title, snippet, etc.) - This will be encrypted but designed to be decryptable by the dApp for public display.
Article main content.
Backend Processing:

Both parts are encrypted separately using a strong encryption method.
Each encrypted segment is then stored on Filecoin.
Two CIDs (Content Identifiers) from Filecoin are generated: one for the metadata and one for the main content.
Output:

The user receives a composite identifier that includes both CIDs and any other metadata.
This composite identifier can be used to retrieve the full article, and the metadata CID can be used to fetch just the title and snippet for public display.
Let's start by working on the backend processing:

1. Encryption:
You'll need a strong encryption method. A simple and popular choice is AES encryption.

2. Filecoin Storage:
Given the choice between Textile's Powergate and ChainSafe, considering end-to-end encryption and simplicity, ChainSafe seems a good fit. However, remember that ChainSafe Files is a conceptual library I mentioned for explanatory purposes. In reality, you would need to use libraries provided by ChainSafe or other Filecoin libraries to interact with the Filecoin network.

3. Output Generation:
After storing on Filecoin, you'll get CIDs which can be combined with other metadata to generate a composite identifier.

Let's begin with the encryption process. Would you like to proceed with AES or have another preference in mind?
